        <h2>Notice: Purchasing Restrictions for Admin Accounts</h2>
        <p>Dear Admin,</p>
        <p>Please be advised that purchasing through admin accounts is strictly prohibited. Admin accounts are solely intended for administrative functions such as managing users, settings, and content. Engaging in purchasing activities using admin privileges is against our company policies and could lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
        <p>To ensure transparency, accountability, and proper financial control, all purchases must be made through designated user accounts with appropriate authorization levels. These accounts are specifically set up for purchasing purposes and are subject to budgetary constraints and approval processes as outlined in our company's procurement policy.</p>
        <p>We remind all administrators to adhere to these guidelines to maintain the integrity of our purchasing procedures and to prevent any potential misuse of administrative privileges. Failure to comply with this directive may result in the suspension or termination of admin privileges, as well as other disciplinary measures.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this notice, please contact the appropriate department or supervisor for clarification.</p>
        <p class="contact-info">Thank you for your cooperation. <a href="#" onclick="history.go(-1); return false;" class="btn">Go Back</a></p>
